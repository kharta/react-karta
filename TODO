Presimplification
- Presimplify projected input geometry
- Dynamically simplify geometry so that the detail is about one square pixel
- Create START_INTERACTION and END_INTERACTION events, to lower the precision and

This should speed up our canvas rendering enough that interactions should be jank-free
even in debug mode.
